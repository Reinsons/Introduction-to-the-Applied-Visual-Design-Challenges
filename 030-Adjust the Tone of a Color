All elements have a default background-color of transparent. Our nav element currently appears to have a cyan background,
because the element behind it has a background-color set to cyan. Add a background-color to the nav element so it uses the same cyan hue,
but has 80% saturation and 25% lightness values to change its tone and shade.
